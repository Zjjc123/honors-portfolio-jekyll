# Honors CS Seminar

When I first set foot into Sieg 134, I had no idea what to expect. This was my first seminar style class that didn’t have more than 100 students. To make it even more confusing, I didn’t know there were any interestings things to discuss about computer science. But I’ve always been interested in smaller sized discussions, so I decided to take a chance by enrolling. And I wasn’t disappointed.

Calling our instructor, Professor Stuart Reges, interesting, would be an understatement. He isn’t afraid to share different ideas, and sometimes unpopular ideas with our group. Our discussion ranges greatly beyond computer science, from our book to politics, mathematical concepts, puzzles, magic tricks, and random anecdotes. I enjoyed every minute of it. It is the only class that I can proudly say I've not missed a single class, although I was pretty late once.

Regardless of whether I agree with any of the ideas or outcomes of our discussion, it felt great to take a deep dive into the mental depth of Reges at the end of every Wednesday. That was the type of things I used to discuss with my high school friends, but I haven’t found the time in college.

The picture is one of the topics we discussed, the Reges Card Trick, which had nothing to do with what the general public considers computer science to be. It sparked my interest as I tried to figure out how it was done. I am, unfortunately, one of the students he referenced that has attempted to solve the trick at 3am.

# Stargazing

A few of my close friends are currently attending college out of state. As I arrived at UW, I found myself struggling to make concrete connections with other students. Although I have met a lot of people, there are very few people that I have continued to talk to. But what I have found is that I got closer to people that I used to consider just acquaintances.

On October 30, 2021, it was forecasted that we would be able to see the Aurora Borealis from Washington State. On a pretty impromptu decision, a couple of friends and I decided to see if we could catch it, by driving an hour out. We met up at a friend's house first and then got in two cars. We drove out to a pretty much abandoned airport, layed down on the grass, and just looked up. I have never seen so many stars before.

Forecasts and predictions of the future are rarely accurate, and we were taught the lesson again. But that was a moment where I felt like I had friends on campus, I made friends, and I got closer to new people.

# First Midterm

This is the first Midterm I have ever taken in college. This is the first midterm we have for MATH 126, on vectors, lines, planes, and surfaces. Going into it, I was not very confident. I just didn’t really study for it. I still remember the ending of that exam. I was going at a good pace and completing each problem that I came across. But when there were 2 minutes left, I still had two sub-questions left. And somehow, under the time pressure, I was able to clutch up and complete the test at the last minute.

Leaving the section, I was pretty confident because I knew I answered every question correctly conceptually, although there might still be small arithmetics errors. Finally, in a week's time, I got my score back. I was pretty surprised to say the least. But I knew that before the next midterm, I still had to improve on my study habits, as one good test doesn’t really mean anything.
