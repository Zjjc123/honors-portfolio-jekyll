<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>My goals and expectations have not changed too much since the start of Autumn quarter. Most of the changes would be decreasing the expectations for myself. I didn’t expect the time and energy I needed to figure out my routine, schedule, and social groups first. That means, I would need more time to find myself involved with other activities than just school. My goal would be to join an RSO by next year but start working on more personal projects first.</p>

<p>Something that surprised me about myself in the first quarter in honors is that I actually enjoyed it. I liked the quiz sections where I found myself talking and being more social than I expected. Although I really didn’t enjoy most of the large lectures.</p>

<p>There were actually a lot of things at UW that weren’t what I expected. First, I expected a large difference between college and high school. But to me, college did not feel like an entirely new experience. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that I know a lot of people already and that I’ve been around Seattle for quite some time, but still. I also did not realize how loose the structure to academics is and how much freedom we have in learning and studying. With that comes the level of personal discipline required to keep up with current learnings. It is really easy to fall behind if I don’t constantly focus on what I have to get done. I also did not realize how difficult it would be to actually make genuine connections with others. Although I have met a fair amount of people over the course of this quarter, I found myself feeling isolated. Not in a sense that I don’t have friends, I have a lot of friends around me most of the time. But I don’t have those people that I fully am able to depend on. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing as I learn to depend on myself, but it hasn’t been the easiest journey since.</p>

<p>I learned about a lot of different activities, resource centers, and honors classes in general. I would like to explore more different opportunities and events. I have signed up for my first full sized honors class next quarter, and I’m really excited to learn in a small group environment from interesting professors. I have also learned about different clubs through our experiential learning activities. I am looking to participate in different types of RSOs ranging from outdoor activities to major related competitions.</p>

<p>I hope that by the end of my first year in Honors, I will come out with a good understanding of the honors program, but more importantly a better understanding of myself and what I want from my years at UW. By the end of my time at UW, I hope to have explored a vast variety of classes and activities from Social Science to Humanities to Interdisciplinary Course to more. I hope to study abroad, to learn more about different cultures but more importantly exploring myself and experiencing time at a place far from home.</p>

<h1 id="honors-cs-seminar">Honors CS Seminar</h1>

<p><img src="/honors-portfolio-jekyll/assets/first-year/CS.jpg" alt="cs" style="border-radius:3%" /></p>

<p>When I first set foot into Sieg 134, I had no idea what to expect. This was my first seminar style class that didn’t have more than 100 students. To make it even more confusing, I didn’t know there were any interestings things to discuss about computer science. But I’ve always been interested in smaller sized discussions, so I decided to take a chance by enrolling. And I wasn’t disappointed.</p>

<p>Calling our instructor, Professor Stuart Reges, interesting, would be an understatement. He isn’t afraid to share different ideas, and sometimes unpopular ideas with our group. Our discussion ranges greatly beyond computer science, from our book to politics, mathematical concepts, puzzles, magic tricks, and random anecdotes. I enjoyed every minute of it. It is the only class that I can proudly say I’ve not missed a single class, although I was pretty late once.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether I agree with any of the ideas or outcomes of our discussion, it felt great to take a deep dive into the mental depth of Reges at the end of every Wednesday. That was the type of things I used to discuss with my high school friends, but I haven’t found the time in college.</p>

<p>The picture is one of the topics we discussed, the Reges Card Trick, which had nothing to do with what the general public considers computer science to be. It sparked my interest as I tried to figure out how it was done. I am, unfortunately, one of the students he referenced that has attempted to solve the trick at 3am.</p>

<h1 id="stargazing">Stargazing</h1>

<p><img src="/honors-portfolio-jekyll/assets/first-year/Stargazing.jpg" alt="stargazing" style="border-radius:3%" /></p>

<p>A few of my close friends are currently attending college out of state. As I arrived at UW, I found myself struggling to make concrete connections with other students. Although I have met a lot of people, there are very few people that I have continued to talk to. But what I have found is that I got closer to people that I used to consider just acquaintances.</p>

<p>On October 30, 2021, it was forecasted that we would be able to see the Aurora Borealis from Washington State. On a pretty impromptu decision, a couple of friends and I decided to see if we could catch it, by driving an hour out. We met up at a friend’s house first and then got in two cars. We drove out to a pretty much abandoned airport, layed down on the grass, and just looked up. I have never seen so many stars before.</p>

<p>Forecasts and predictions of the future are rarely accurate, and we were taught the lesson again. But that was a moment where I felt like I had friends on campus, I made friends, and I got closer to new people.</p>

<h1 id="first-midterm">First Midterm</h1>

<p><img src="/honors-portfolio-jekyll/assets/first-year/Midterm.png" alt="midterm" /></p>

<p>This is the first Midterm I have ever taken in college. This is the first midterm we have for MATH 126, on vectors, lines, planes, and surfaces. Going into it, I was not very confident. I just didn’t really study for it. I still remember the ending of that exam. I was going at a good pace and completing each problem that I came across. But when there were 2 minutes left, I still had two sub-questions left. And somehow, under the time pressure, I was able to clutch up and complete the test at the last minute.</p>

<p>Leaving the section, I was pretty confident because I knew I answered every question correctly conceptually, although there might still be small arithmetics errors. Finally, in a week’s time, I got my score back. I was pretty surprised to say the least. But I knew that before the next midterm, I still had to improve on my study habits, as one good test doesn’t really mean anything.</p>
